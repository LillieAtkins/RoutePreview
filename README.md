## About RoutePreview

RoutePreview was created to help outdoor enthusiasts feel more comfortable exploring new areas and routes. Apps such as Strava allow users to draw out new routes; however, it is often hard to know what this route will entail . If someone wanted to preview their route they would need to go onto Google Maps and manually street view each position along the route  which can become very time consuming and tedious. RoutePreview allows users to preview their mapped out routes with a click of a button so they can feel comfortable exploring anywhere they travel. RoutePreview is a Google Chrome extension that is embedded in the Strava user interface. When a user creates a route, a “Route Preview” button appears next to the route. When the user clicks on this button, a popup appears that takes them through a movie of Google Street View images to help them get a better understanding of what to expect on their route.
